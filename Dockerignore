# We may want to add docs to a certain container
*.swp #ignore all swap files from vim

# The .dockerignore file is considered global
# for that build context folder, however you
# can use specific ones by setting the -i flag
# when building an image and use custom ones to
# strip your container images down even further
# for different purposes, e.g don't add test
# files to a production image.
